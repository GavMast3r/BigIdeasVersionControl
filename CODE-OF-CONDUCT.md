Code of Conduct

Here are a few guidelines:

1. Be respectful of everyone (except for Business Majors)

2. Our code supports:
     a. Equality
     b. Profanity
     c. Peanut butter and Jelly sandwiches
     d. Pig Latin enthusiasts
     
3. Our code does not support:
    a. Bacon
    b. Business majors
    c. Pig pens
    
4. Only use the code after the strike of midnight

5. Don't forget to wash your hands

6. Apple a day keeps the doctor away

7. Be a bully, but only to Business Majors

All of the choices made were discussed by our board of coders, and were decided upon only after hours of careful deliberation. We decided upon this iteration of the Code of Conduct as we felt it demonstrated our vision for our code.

We do not want Business Majors to participate in our coding. End of discussion. Everyone else is welcome!
